![I'm a full-stack developer, tech enthusiast, and designer currently working at OWiC Technologies, where I'm developing cutting-edge nanotechnology solutions.
I studied Computer Science at Cornell University, and have a diverse portfolio of projects, including games, programming languages, and mobile apps.
In my free time, I dabble in animation, cooking, acrylic painting, and language learning. Let's connect and collaborate!](banner.webp)
