I'm Computer Science student at Cornell University slated to graduate in 2022 with an interest in all things tech. I'm proficient in a wide variety of languages from JavaScript to OCaml to Chinese. On the side, I dabble in animation, video editing, acrylic painting, and game design. Feel free to take a look at my work below!
